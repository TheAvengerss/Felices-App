Final Project

Creating an app for Felice's Roman Style pizza that will help with the efficiency in the store. The app will help streamline the inventory taking process, as well as help with the upcoming delivery aspect being added to operations. 

The app will initially be made to run on Windows Phone 8, and eventually will branch out to all Windows 8 platforms. 

We are using Visual Studio 2013 for Windows 8.1 to code the app, in C# and XAML.
